TODO
====
- ultimately, try mixing learned responses and get teacher feedback
- go back to possible response list more often and get new response possibility if available (especially if the response is a 1)?
- randomize the high level weight responses (so that the first one doesn't always get picked first...)
- pick response from grab bag for newly-created phrase keys

+ convert 0/word to dictionary (for efficiency...) word:0
+ store newly-learned keys
+ use short string if key is found (first try)
+ if learnedResponse key is not found, try looking for a slightly smaller part of the key (i like green things -> i like green -> i like)
